Compiler
Compiler, computer software that compiles source code written in a high-level language like
java, into a set of machine-language instructions that can be understood by the CPU of a digital
computer. Compilers are very large programs, with error-checking and other capabilities.

Interpreter
An interpreter executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without
converting them into object code or machine code beforehand. Examples of interpreted
languages are Perl, Python. For interpreted programs, the source code is needed every time the
program is run
